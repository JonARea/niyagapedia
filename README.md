## Running the app
npm install
npm start

## Running the tests
start your local mongodb

# Background
The Solonese gamelan music scene has suffered the loss of many famous musicians in the past few years. I hope this simple record can help document notable musicians to keep their memories alive permanently.

# A note about the app
This project was also a vehicle for me to teach myself Express, using Pug as the view engine, and was the first project I created with either of these technologies. A lot of the code is therefore cobbled together from various tutorials, and in places I've used it as a sandbox for playing around and having fun.

# In progress
