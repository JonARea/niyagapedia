An encyclopedia of Javanese gamelan musicians

# Background
The Solonese gamelan music scene has suffered the loss of many famous musicians in the past few years. I hope this simple record can help document notable musicians to keep their memories alive permanently.

# A note about the app
This project was also a vehicle for me to teach myself Express, using Pug as the view engine, and was the first project I created with either of these technologies. A lot of the code is therefore cobbled together from various tutorials, and in places I've used it as a sandbox for playing around and having fun.


# Future features:

Photo upload capability for groups

Ability to select multiple musicians for one photo

Timelines of players for each instrument in the group
